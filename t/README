This directory contains the MetaText test scripts (*.t):
  ./basic.t     Test basic directives such as %% DEFINE %% and %% SUBST %% 

Other files:
  ./test.pl     Common file for all test scripts.

Additional directories:
  ./src         Source files used by test scripts
  ./dest        Post-process output written here
  ./expect      Expected output, compared against equivalent ./dest file
  ./elements    Element files used by the above

The scripts are fairly badly hacked together and the tests are largely 
incomplete.  Erm, sorry about that.  The test results get written to the
logfile, test.log.
