This directory contains the MetaText test scripts (*.t):
  ./block.t     Test BLOCK declarations
  ./chomp.t     Tests chomping of newlines
  ./declare.t   Test pre-declared blocks
  ./define.t    Test variable definitions
  ./eval.t      Test expression evaluation code
  ./exec.t      Test execution options (EXECUTE)
  ./include.t   Test INCLUDE directive
  ./rogue.t     Test handling of unrecognised directives (ROQGUE)
  ./subst.t     Test basic SUBST directive

Other files:
  ./test.pl     Common file for all test scripts.

Additional directories:
  ./src         Source files used by test scripts
  ./dest        Post-process output written here
  ./expect      Expected output, compared against equivalent ./dest file
  ./lib         Element files used by the above

Test results are written to the logfile, test.log.

The test scripts may be a little obscure in places especially as they
often try to tickle the deepest, darkest innards of MetaText into 
spewing forth a bug.  Having said that, they are a good starting place 
for seeing how the different directives work and what can be done.

If you uncover a bug in MetaText, the best way to demonstrate it is
to create a small, simple test script that illustrates the problem.
Not only does that help me reproduce it easily, but it also means I 
have a test script ready to install in this suite to check that it 
doesn't happen again.
