# The following variables are set as CASEVARS.  They must be passed into 
# the MetaText->process_xxxx() and an appropriate reference must also be
# made in the CASEVARS configuration item.  These variable values will
# be used when a SUBST directive names it in *exactly* the same case as
# defined.  A variable specified in any other case will be treated as 
# a normal variable.  Thus, it is possible to define 'SPECIAL' which 
# must be used as 'SPECIAL' but also to have a 'special' variable which
# can be specified in any case combination (apart from 'SPECIAL', of 
# course).  Metapage uses this to define certain "SYSTEM" variables
# that a) can't be re-defined and b) don't stomp on any existing user
# variables of the same name.
