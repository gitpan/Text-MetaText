# this tests pre-defined variables that are passed into the

# CASE sensitivity is OFF.  Expected text is shown in (parenthesis).

 foo (predef-foo): predef-foo
 bar (predef-bar): predef-bar



 newfoo(NEWpredef-foo): NEWpredef-foo
$newfoo(NEWpredef-foo): NEWpredef-foo

$newbar(NEWpredef-bar): NEWpredef-bar


#
# The following variables are set as CASEVARS.  They must be passed into 
# the MetaText->process_xxxx() and an appropriate reference must also be
# made in the CASEVARS configuration item.  These variable values will
# be used when a SUBST directive names it in *exactly* the same case as
# defined.  A variable specified in any other case will be treated as 
# a normal variable.  Thus, it is possible to define 'SPECIAL' which 
# must be used as 'SPECIAL' but also to have a 'special' variable which
# can be specified in any case combination (apart from 'SPECIAL', of 
# course).  Metapage uses this to define certain "SYSTEM" variables
# that a) can't be re-defined and b) don't stomp on any existing user
# variables of the same name.
