# check that chomp works...
# this comment line should immediately proceed the previous one when 
# CHOMP is enabled (chomp.1).  With CHOMP disabled (chomp.2), there 
# should be 2 blank lines between them which are the newlines trailing
# after the DEFINE directives above.  

# These examples have extraneous characters and whitespace between the
# end of the directive and EOL which should over-ride the CHOMPer
   
  .
# that's it for CHOMP


# now let's INCLUDE a block that has been TRIMmed (default)...
-->foo/1  This is block foo
foo/2  This block is trimmed (default)<-- 
# ...and one that hasn't been trimmed by explicitly stating "trim=0"
-->bar/1  This is block bar
bar/2  This block is not trimmed
<--
# that's it for trim
